# Store Sales Analysis

In this analysis, we explore a dataset comprising two sheets of data: "Orders" and "Revenue." These sheets contain essential information related to store sales, including order details, product information, customer data, shipping information, and financial data such as revenue, profit, loss, and discounts.

## Dataset Overview

### Orders Sheet
The "Orders" table provides comprehensive order information, including:
- Product details
- Customer details
- Shipping address
- Package type

### Revenue Sheet
The "Revenue" table contains financial data related to store sales, which includes:
- Store sales
- Discounts
- Shipping charges
- Profit
- Loss
- Discounts

## Business Problem

A Sales Manager seeks to gain insights from this dataset to formulate a data-driven business strategy. Specifically, they aim to address the following key questions:

### Priority Orders Analysis
The Sales Manager wants to understand the different priority levels of orders, their associated order quantities, and the revenue generated by these orders. This analysis helps in identifying which types of orders have the most significant impact on revenue.

### Region-wise Margin Analysis
To optimize profit margins, the Sales Manager aims to identify which regional stores are performing well in terms of profitability and consistently generating a substantial number of orders over time. This analysis will assist in focusing on regions that contribute positively to the company's financial health.

In this analysis, we will provide insights and visualizations to address these questions, aiding the Sales Manager in making informed decisions and devising effective business strategies.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation Steps

### Step 1: Cleaning Unnecessary Columns or Rows
We began by cleaning the dataset to remove any unnecessary blank columns or rows, ensuring that we work with clean and complete data.

### Step 2: Splitting the "Location" Column in the Orders Table
The "Location" column in the Orders table contained combined information about the region and state separated by a colon (:). We split this column using a custom delimiter (:) and renamed the resulting columns as "Region" and "State" to provide a clearer view of the data.

### Step 3: Creating a New Custom Column in the Revenue Table
To calculate the "Discounted Shipping Price," we added a new custom column in the Revenue table. This column was calculated using the formula (Shipping Cost - Discount).

### Step 4: Adding an Index Column in the Orders Table
To enhance data management, we created an "Order Sl. No" column in the Orders table. This index column ranges from 1 with an increment of 1, allowing us to uniquely identify each order.

### Step 5: Changing Data Types
We changed the data types of the "Order ID," "Order Sl. No," and "Customer ID" columns in the Orders table to text. This change ensures consistency and compatibility in further data processing and analysis.

### Step 6: Adding a Conditional Column in the Revenue Table
To identify profitable orders, we added a conditional column in the Revenue table named "Profitable Order." The condition applied was Profit > 1000. If the condition is met, the column is marked as "Yes"; otherwise, it is marked as "No."
